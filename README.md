# SmashTool
small randomizer tool for Super Smash Bros. to make a best of 5 conquest match

#Why
I frequently play Super Smash Bros.(SSB) with my suitemates but the same Fox v. Little Mac matchup everyday can get very stale
This tool forces us to play characters out of our comfort zone for a fun match every time

#What is it?
Using files containing the names of all the different fighters in Smash, it generates 3 random characters for each of the two players.
Players must then win with all 3 of their characters to win the match
